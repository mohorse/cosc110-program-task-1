#I really enjoyed program task 1 "Review.Me". i started by asking the user to input
#the name of the resturant then i asked user how many critics. I then asked the user to #enter a rating for 3 different options Food, Wine and Atmosphere i then take the critics
#rating andgive back an average. I had a bit of trouble with giving the user the "na"
#option but i think i solved it with a "while True" and "try except" loop. If user fills
#out the options correctly the program works.
